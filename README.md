# Goal

The goal is to automate the tedious task of converting `.tfstate` to `.tf` files. **Not even Terraform itself supports this!** That shouldn't stop us from a tool with _partial_ automation. This is **"Terraformish"**

## Core Objectives

Write generic code that is not specific to one cloud provider or one cloud resource

## Terraformish vs Others

|                     | Terraformish                                                              | Others                                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Reliability         | ‚úÖ For ALL resources <br/> üü° Produces ~80% accurate code                 | üü° For SOME resources <br/> ‚úÖ Produces exact `.tf` file                       |
| Supported resources | ‚úÖ Supports ALL `.tfstates`                                               | ‚ùå Support varies based on resource                                            |
| Strategy            | ‚úÖ Easy to maintain generic reusable code that achieves most of your goal | ‚ùå Unrealistic to support all fields for all resources for all cloud providers |
